I am a IT Engineering student with a strong interest in software and mobile application development. I enjoy building practical applications that solve real problems and improve user experience.

I have experience working with Flutter for mobile app development and have also explored web development technologies. I like learning new technologies, improving my programming skills, and understanding how complete software systems are built.
